# BT_google: LAP 1 Code Challenge: Google
### By Talha and Bethan 

## Assingment Description 
In this pair assignment, we were asked to create homepage ressembling the Google homepage, a page displaying 10 results after clicking the Google Search button, and 1 webpage which displays after clicking the 'feeling lucky' button.
The contents of the homepage include the logo, searchbar and the 2 buttons. 

## Installation

- First time installation: type `npm install` to install all neccessary dependencies 
- To run the code: type `npm start` 

## Problems and Challenges 

- We had difficulty with the fetch request. On Bethan's machine it worked, however after pushing, it didn't seem to work on Talha's machine. We believe there is a problem with the pathway.
- Similarly, we originally started with a Client / Server folder distribution, but found we had many pathway errors. Given the time-pressured nature of the assignment, we decided to remove these barriers and place all the files in the same folder.
- We also had some issues with merging and project distribution on GitHub.
